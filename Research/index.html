	<p> I am a statistician interested in developing statistical learning methods for analyzing massive biological data.
	Such biological data are often high-dimensional and may have additional structures. 
    These structures explain how individual biological components interact with one another in the complex biological system. 
Effectively understanding and using these structures has the potential for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems. 		
Some projects that I have been working on are:
	<ul>
		<li> Functional regression models for high-dimensional neuroimaging data.</li>
		<li> Prediction and inference for high-dimensional structured data. </li>
		<li> Vector autoregressive models for high-dimensional time series data. </li>
	</ul>
	Selected preprints and publications (Methodology):
	<ul>
		<li> Lu, Z. H., Khondker, Z., Ibrahim, J. G., <em>Wang, Y.</em>, Zhu, H. (2017). Bayesian longitudinal low-rank regression models for imaging genetic data from longitudinal studies. <i>NeuroImage</i>, 149, 305-322.<\li>
