	<h1>Hi there, I'm Yue Wang!</h1>
	<p>I am Senior Fellow at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Washington. My mentors are [Dr. Ali Shojaie](http://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html) from UW and Dr. Jing Ma from Texas A&M University.
	I also work closely with Dr. Timothy Randolph from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center. I obtained my PhD in 2018 at the Department
	of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the supervision of Drs. Hongtu Zhu and Joseph Ibrahim. I am currently developing statistical learning methods
	for high-dimensional data with complex structures, including neuroimaging data and multi-omics data, to address cutting-edge biological, medical and public health problems. </p>
